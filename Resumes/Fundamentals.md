# Fundamentals

Okay, you got a new job and are prontly asked to analyze the company dataset and get some cool insights.
Once you get access to the dataset, it's important for you to understand the processes behind Data Science, as following:

1. Collect/produce data.
2. Check the usability and structure of all attributes. Are they important and usable for your current analysis?
3. Clean up the data. Make sure to leave only what's important (remember to backup!)
4. Maintenance. Store your data safely.
5. Process. Use math and stathistics knowledge in order to produce valorous data for the company.
6. Analyze. Use analytical thinking and data science tools to find patterns and produce rich insights.
7. Reccomend. Build reccomendations to your company. You may save it (or blow it up).
8. Present your data. Create elegant dashboards with all the data you gathered and focus on storytelling (this may give you a rise)!

This is what a good data scientist does. Focus on it everytime you enroll into a new project.
