Okay, you got a new job and are prontly asked to analyze the company dataset and get some cool insights.
Once you get access to the dataset, it's important for you to understand the processes behind Data Science, such as following:

1. Collect/produce data.
2. Check the usability and structure of all attributes. Are they important and usable for your current analysis?
3. Clean up the data. Make sure to leave only what's important (remember to backup!).
4. Maintenance. Store your data safely.
5. Process. Use math and stathistics knowledge in order to produce valorous data for the company.
6. Analyze. Use analytical thinking and data science tools to find patterns and produce rich insights.
7. Reccomend. Build reccomendations to your company. You may save it (or blow it up).
8. Present your data. Create elegant dashboards with all the data you gathered and focus on storytelling (this may give you a rise!).

This is what a good data scientist does. Focus on it everytime you enroll into a new project.

Analytical thinking is the main skill of every data scientist. It's possible to learn how to think analytically by following these steps when making a decision (small or big ones):

- Question about the reliability of sources;
- Think about the methodology used to get a certain info/insight;
- Do **not** accept any thuth without questioning about it;
- Think before doing;
- Follow the scientific method in order to obtain valid data.
